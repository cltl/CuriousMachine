TVX Gold Inc was up C$ 0.30 to C$ 11.55 in trading of 780,000 shares , while Kinross Gold Corp gained C$ 0.25 to C$ 11 in volume of 720,000 shares . And Scorpion Minerals Inc , a junior gold exploration company with five Indonesian mining properties , was up C$ 0.50 to C$ 6 , with about 120,000 shares changing hands . TVX and Kinross rose after recent buy recommendations from U.S. brokers , analysts said . But Scorpion was raising a lot of eyebrows after it issued a release Friday morning saying it was not aware of any developments that could have affected the stock . The company was formed this year and a couple of analysts have been on their properties , said one analyst . Exploration results are expected soon . -- Reuters Toronto Bureau 416 941-8100 ]]></raw>
