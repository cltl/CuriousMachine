  <raw><![CDATA[German police made Nazi gestures , officials say . NUREMBERG , Germany 1996-08-28 German riot police made Nazi gestures at a private function earlier this month and may face dismissal for their actions , the Bavarian Interior Ministry said on Wednesday . The ministry declined to detail gestures the Nuremberg-based policemen had made at the August 13 function but added seven had been suspended from duty pending an internal inquiry . A spokesman for public prosecutors in the southern city , where dictator Adolf Hitler held some of his most infamous Nazi party rallies in the 1930s , said there were no plans to prosecute the officers as the gestures had not been made in public . ]]></raw>
