  <raw><![CDATA[Egypt to press Britain over Islamist conference . CAIRO 1996-08-26 Egypt will tell Britain it is concerned about a meeting of Islamists to be held in London soon , Foreign Minister Amr Moussa said on Monday . " There is a question mark over this issue . We , and many other countries , do n't understand this ( Britain 's ) position , " Moussa told reporters . " Egypt will contact the British government to find out the truth of the matter and to discuss the possible consequences of such an unfortunate step , " he added . Egyptian government newspapers have criticised Britain for allowing Islamists , whom they brand as " terrorists " , to hold their conference , saying the meeting will be a chance for dangerous Moslem militants to plot against their countries of origin . It is not clear when the conference will be held . About 1,000 people have been killed in Egypt since Islamic militants took up arms in 1992 in an attempt to overthrow the government and set up a strict Islamic state . Cairo says several Egyptian militants on the run from death sentences or convictions for violent attacks at home have taken shelter in Britain . ]]></raw>
