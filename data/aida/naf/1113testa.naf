" For myself , personally , I 've planned things so that that will be the end of me , " the 32-year-old national team captain was quoted as saying by the daily Sueddeutsche Zeitung on Saturday . Klinsmann said he believed Germany could win in France with the same nucleus of players which won the European championship in England this summer . " I think it can be done , " he said , " especially as experience is becoming more and more valuable in sport . I think we can do it with the same body of players . That 's what we 're all aiming for . " Coach Berti Vogts has called up a virtually identical squad for next week 's friendly against Poland -- Germany 's first match since Euro 96 . ]]></raw>
