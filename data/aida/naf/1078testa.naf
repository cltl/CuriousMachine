  <raw><![CDATA[SOCCER - INCE EXPOSED BY GASCOIGNE 'S LATEST PRANK . CHISINAU , Moldova 1996-08-31 England 's irrepressible midfielder Paul Gascoigne was up to his old tricks on Saturday , pulling down his team mate Paul Ince 's trousers in front of an astonished crowd in Moldova . Ince was clambering over a wall at the Republican stadium in Chisinau as Glenn Hoddle 's England players tried to escape heavy rain during an under-21 clash . Gascoigne , whose compulsive practical joking has landed him in trouble in the past , tugged down the Inter Milan player 's trousers in front of a group of press photographers . Hoddle , coaching the side for the first time , declined to comment on the incident . England face Moldova in a World Cup qualifier in the same stadium on Sunday . ]]></raw>
