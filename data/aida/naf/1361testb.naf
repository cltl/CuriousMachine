WHISTLER , British Columbia 1996-12-06 World Cup ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men 's downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage the weekend racing programme . For the third consecutive day , Friday 's scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on Whistler Mountain , leaving the scheduled World Cup events in jeopardy . Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World Cup downhill race can be staged . Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning , conditions permitting , and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday . " There was no possibility today to make a training run , " said Bernd Zobel , the Canadian men 's national coach , citing too much new snow and poor visibility . If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday , the super-giant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned . ]]></raw>
