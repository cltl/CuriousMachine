VIENNA 1996-08-29 Austrian viscose fibre maker Lenzing AG said on Thursday it expected to post negative group results in the second half of the year after posting losses in the first six months . " A preview of the second half of 1996 does not reveal any signs of a significant improvement in market conditions , " Lenzing said in a statement released ahead of its earnings conference . For the first six months of the year , Lenzing said it posted a group pre-tax loss of 84.5 million schillings from a profit of 160 million in the year-ago period . The group attributed the first-half losses to weak demand and falling prices of viscose fibres , as well as sluggish economies in the West . -- Julia Ferguson , Vienna newsroom , +431 53112 274 ]]></raw>
