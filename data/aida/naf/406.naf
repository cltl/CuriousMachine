LEEDS , England 1996-08-26 Winger Lee Sharpe hit a superb strike from the edge of the penalty area to give Leeds their first win of the season on Monday and leave hapless Wimbledon anchored at the bottom of the England premier league . Sharpe repaid a huge slice of the 4.5 million pound ( $ 6.98 million ) fee Leeds handed Manchester United for his services with a top-draw second-half goal to hand Wimbledon their third successive defeat . Ian Rush , the Welsh striker signed from Liverpool in the close season , set up the goal , feeding Sharpe as he galloped forward and the former England winger cut inside onto his unfavoured right foot to arc a shot into the right-hand corner of the net . The only goal of the match also brought some relief for under-fire Leeds manager Howard Wilkinson following the team 's poor start to the season . Home fans frequently booed their own side until Sharpe turned the jeers to cheers . ]]></raw>
